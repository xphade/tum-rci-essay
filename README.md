# My colleague is a robot:<br />How co-bots are going to enrich the human workforce

This repo contains an essay I wrote for an application to the Master's program "Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence" at the TU MÃ¼nchen (Technical University of Munich). I am publishing it as a resource for future applicants to give them some ideas for their own essay. I got accepted to the program, so it cannot be too bad. ;)

If you want to apply to the program: __Be smart, do not copy!__

The task was to write an essay about one of three available topics. Word count should be approximately 1000, outside sources have to be cited.<br />
The topics were:
* Artificial Intelligence - Praise the new robot leaders!
* My colleague is a robot 
* Autonomous cars - Entrust your life to a robot!
